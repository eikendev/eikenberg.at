I'm a computer science enthusiast, and I love to solve problems related to both software and hardware. At the moment, I'm studying for my Master's degree in information security at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/).

Over the years, I've developed various tools, mainly for personal use. Have a look at [my portfolio](https://www.eiken.dev/) or directly visit my public profiles to see what I've worked on so far. I also run a [blog](https://www.eiken.dev/blog) where I cover topics in computer science.

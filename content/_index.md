I currently spend most of my time creating fancy slides and proofreading.
And I have a passion for cybersecurity.
In a free minute, you find me coding and tinkering with new tools and technologies.

Now that you're here, you can check out some of my projects on [my portfolio](https://www.eiken.dev/).
And if you want to know what's on my mind, be sure to check out my [blog](https://www.eiken.dev/blog) where I write about random topics that spark my curiosity.
